# My First Portfolio - HTML Basics

This repository contains my first steps in creating a personal portfolio website using HTML. Below is an overview of the tasks completed:

## Task 0: Basic Structure
- Created `base_index.html` with the most basic, valid HTML structure
- Includes:
  - DOCTYPE declaration
  - Head with title
  - Body
- Validated using the official HTML Validator

**File:** `html_basic/base_index.html`

## Task 1: First Webpage
- Copied `base_index.html` to `index.html`
- Added content to the body:
  - 4+ paragraphs
  - Headings (h1, h2, h3)
  - Clickable image (linking to any URL)

**File:** `html_basic/index.html`

## Task 2: Tweets Webpage
- Created `tweets.html` from `base_index.html`
- Added:
  - Embedded tweet
  - Link back to index.html
- Added reciprocal link from index.html to tweets.html

**Files:** `html_basic/index.html`, `html_basic/tweets.html`

## Task 3: Website Structure
- Standardized structure across all HTML files:
  - Body contains exactly (in order):
    - `<header>` with navigation (unordered list of links)
    - `<main>` containing:
      - `<article>` (existing content)
      - `<aside>` (placeholder for comments)
    - `<footer>` with attribution line

**Files:** `html_basic/index.html`, `html_basic/tweets.html`

## Task 4: Learners Table
- Added a table to index.html before closing `</article>`
- Table structure:
  - `<thead>` for header row
  - `<tbody>` for data rows
- Sample data:
  - Name, Age, Country
  - 4 sample learners

**File:** `html_basic/index.html`

## Task 5: Personal Portfolio
Created a dedicated portfolio page with:

### Structure
- DOCTYPE and proper HTML declaration
- Semantic elements: header, nav, section, article, footer

### Sections
1. **Header**:
   - Name in h1
   - Professional tagline

2. **Navigation**:
   - Links to: Introduction, Projects, About Me, Contact

3. **Content**:
   - Introduction section
   - Projects section (each in article tags)

This project demonstrates my growing understanding of HTML structure, semantic markup, and webpage organization. Each task builds upon the previous one to create a cohesive personal portfolio website.
